## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a single-page React app that uses state in order to track the changes that take place within a tap room. It should be capable of displaying a full list of drinks available, the amount remaining of each drink, details about each specific drink, and the ability to add and delete kegs from the list.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

If you wish to edit the code base or deploy the project on your machine, you'll need:
1. Node (or other package manager)
2. A terminal, such as GIT Bash or Windows Powershell
3. A code editor
4. Git (optional)

### Installing

1. Acquire the repo, by either clicking the download button or running `git clone https://github.com/Sudolphus/Tap-Room`
2. Install the packages. With Node, this can be done by navigating into the taproom directory and running `npm install`
3. To run the project, run `npm start`, which will load a development build in your browser.
4. Alternately, `npm run build` will create a build folder with a production build, which can then be opened in your browser. For other useful scripts, please see the [React Readme](React_README.md)

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To use the program, simply load it in your browser, by running the steps above to create a development or production build. Once it's in your browser, the links within in the app should default to a list of the drinks availabe (which will start empty), with a link to add drinks to the menu. Once a drink is added, it should be clickable, which will take you to a details page that contain more information about that drink, as well as links to edit the data for the drink, or remove the drink from the menu.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

This project should be entirely self contained, so once the file is built, opening it in the browser should be all you need to do to deploy it.

## Components <a name = "components"></a>
